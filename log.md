# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Brainstorming and Deciding on which Public API to work on. Decided to go with an anime API. Was able to communicate to the Anime API. Cleanup of initial setup code is required.

**Thoughts:** It feels really good to start from scratch.

**Link to work:** Not Yet Created

### Day 2: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made little enhancements to the api, trying to make it similar to the Public API. Created the GitHub Repo. 

**Thoughts:** Let's see how it goes. Need more improvements. Need to decide on the front-end part. Also if persistence is required for the use-case has to be evaluated. Need to explore other technologies with this, for learning purposes.

### Day 3: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to work on a different issue, to call getters based on column names of a table

**Thoughts:** Was not able to find a proper solution. Tried a few approaches using reflection, which didn't work

**Link to work:** NONE


### Day 3: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Infoweeb. Figured out how to get field values and their respective getters.

**Thoughts:** Made some progress. Since it was a weekend, spend most time with family. Lots to learn, lots to schedule and plan. Need to clean the code further. Have another usecase of trying Instagram APIs. Will try to integrate here itself as a process of learning.
