# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Brainstorming and Deciding on which Public API to work on. Decided to go with an anime API. Was able to communicate to the Anime API. Cleanup of initial setup code is required.

**Thoughts:** It feels really good to start from scratch.

**Link to work:** Not Yet Created


### Day 2: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made little enhancements to the api, trying to make it similar to the Public API. Created the GitHub Repo. 

**Thoughts:** Let's see how it goes. Need more improvements. Need to decide on the front-end part. Also if persistence is required for the use-case has to be evaluated. Need to explore other technologies with this, for learning purposes.

### Day 3: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to work on a different issue, to call getters based on column names of a table

**Thoughts:** Was not able to find a proper solution. Tried a few approaches using reflection, which didn't work

**Link to work:** NONE


### Day 4: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Infoweeb. Figured out how to get field values and their respective getters.

**Thoughts:** Made some progress. Since it was a weekend, spend most time with family. Lots to learn, lots to schedule and plan. Need to clean the code further. Have another usecase of trying Instagram APIs. Will try to integrate here itself as a process of learning.

### Day 5: September 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added db configuration for Infoweeb

**Thoughts:** Took some time integrating with mysql db, because of inconsistent dependency versions, and some configurations for db. But finally integrated. Need to make a lot of enhancements. Created a dummy API for now to add users to the Users Table. But this will modified later.

### Day 6: September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on Task Entity

**Thoughts:** Basically created an entity for task, which has fields like task name, task details, category, minutes spent, start and end time. The goal is basically to track a task of an user each day. Having basic fields as of now. Created the basic controller to post and get tasks. Need to setup some autofilling during null values

### Day 7: September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on Task Entity

**Thoughts:** Passing only time spent for now. With the assumption that, the task was completed at that time approximately, making starttime as current time - time spent and endtime as current time.

### Day 8: September 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Stopping Infoweeb, Building a CMS

**Thoughts:** I have stopped working on infoweeb personal project. I decided to build a mini cms platform with basic functionalities. This for a personal use case. Built the basic project structure and db design. Need to create the git repo still. Will be doing that tomorrow

**Link to work:** TODO

### Day 9: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the backend in heroku

**Thoughts:** So the basic entities are created with some authorisation using jwt. The security part needs a little more in depth understand from code. Was able to setup postgre sql in heroku and linked it to the backend using environment variables. Need to start with the front end part.
