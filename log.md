# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Brainstorming and Deciding on which Public API to work on. Decided to go with an anime API. Was able to communicate to the Anime API. Cleanup of initial setup code is required.

**Thoughts:** It feels really good to start from scratch.

**Link to work:** Not Yet Created

### Day 2: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made little enhancements to the api, trying to make it similar to the Public API. Created the GitHub Repo. 

**Thoughts:** Let's see how it goes. Need more improvements. Need to decide on the front-end part. Also if persistence is required for the use-case has to be evaluated. Need to explore other technologies with this, for learning purposes.
